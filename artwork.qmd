I have been a painter since 2017, after the stimulating encounter with professional painter [Guido Buganza](https://www.guidobuganza.com/).

In 2018, I have won the "Looking for Art" paiting contest, which allowed me to exibithion my paintings at Milan "La Triennale". In 2019, I had my first personal exibithion at Spazio Arte Tirabassi (Milan).
