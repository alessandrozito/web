## About me

Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in Biostatistics at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), where I am supervised by Professor [Jeffrey W. Miller](https://jwmi.github.io/) and Professor [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/), in North Carolina. Prior to living in the United States in 2019, I studied Economics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home/programs/master+of+science/economic+and+social+sciences), in Milan, Italy.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](files/resume.pdf). A complete list of publications is available [here](research.qmd).

[E-mail]{.blue} - [azito\@hsph.harvard.edu](azito@hsph.harvard.edu)

[Research interests]{.harvardred} - Bayesian statistics, Bayesian nonparametrics, Bioinformatics, Cancer genomics, Factor models, Mutational signature analysis.

### News

\[[August 2024]{.blue}\] My postdoc advisor Jeff Miller will be presenting *Compressive Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization for mutational signature analysis* at the IMS conference in Berlin.

\[[July 2024]{.blue}\] I presented my work *Bayesian nonparametric modeling of latent partitions via Stirling-gamma priors* (poster) and *Compressive Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization for mutational signature analysis* (talk) at the ISBA world meeting 2024. ISBA is the main international conference fro Bayesian statistics.
