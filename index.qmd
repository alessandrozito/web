## [Great news!]{.gred}

[To all j-ISBA members, I am running as [j-ISBA treasurer]{.gblue} for this coming October election! ]{.gred}

[Would love to have your support to help me foster the new generation of Bayesian researchers and scientists. A detailed program of what I intend to do is available \[[here](jISBA_elections.qmd)\].]{.gred}

Welcome to my website!

I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in Biostatistics at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), where I am supervised by Professor [Jeffrey W. Miller](https://jwmi.github.io/) and Professor [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani/). I am also affiliated with the Data Sciences department at the [Dana-Farber cancer institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/research/departments-centers/data-science).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/), in North Carolina, where I worked under the supervision of Professor [David Dunson](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=KwEOawwAAAAJ&hl=en) within Project [LIFEPLAN](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/projects/lifeplan), an international research group whose aim is to quantify biodiversity across the globe.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](files/resume_alezito.pdf). A complete list of publications is available [here](research.qmd).

[Secondary e-mail]{.blue} - [alessandro\_zito\@dfci.harvard.edu](alessandro_zito@dfci.harvard.edu)

My research interests include Bayesian statistics, Bayesian nonparametrics and factor models for cancer genomics, mutational signature analysis and ecology.

### News

//\[[August 2024]{.blue}\] My postdoc advisor Jeff Miller will be presenting *Compressive Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization for mutational signature analysis* at the IMS conference in Berlin.

\[[July 2024]{.blue}\] I presented my work *Bayesian nonparametric modeling of latent partitions via Stirling-gamma priors* (poster) and *Compressive Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization for mutational signature analysis* (talk) at the ISBA world meeting 2024. ISBA is the main international conference fro Bayesian statistics.
